# Project Report - Week 6

This week I did not do any major changes to the program as the current version fulfills the course requirements and improving the algorithm with a new heuristic would need large changes that I have no time to implement and that would probably be out of the scope of this 4 ECTS course. Therefore, this week I have only improved the documentation in the code and added an empirical testing part in the testing document. I have also done one peer review. The most challenging part this week was the peer review as understanding a whole new problem takes time and reading code written by someone else is always time-consuming, especially when the topic is totally new for you.
