# Project Report - Week 5

This week I have added a graphical user interface component to the program in the form of GraphicalUI-class. This class is responsible for opening a graphical window for the user after the program has solved the given puzzle. With this window the user can proceed step by step the optimal solution path by clicking space everytime he/she wants to see the following step the solver took to solve the puzzle. The implementation of this class required me to learn the basics of the pygame module. In addition to this, I have peer reviewed one project and continued to improve the documentation of the program.

The most challenging part this week was analyzing the time and space complexity of my implementation of the algorithm and the performance- and O-analysis comparison of the heuristics.
